## Recent Changes
- **Nov 18, 2025**: 🐛 CRITICAL ADMIN PANEL FIX - Fixed admin panel only showing 50 most recent bookings by creation date, hiding future bookings created earlier. Now shows ALL future bookings sorted by date, plus 50 recent past bookings.
- **Nov 18, 2025**: 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIX - CANCELLED BOOKINGS - Fixed availability API incorrectly marking cancelled bookings as unavailable. Cancelled bookings now properly excluded from calendar availability and blocked slot conflict detection.
- **Nov 17, 2025**: 🔧 CRITICAL AVAILABILITY FIX - Fixed booking calendar not showing existing bookings as unavailable. Date parameter wasn't being sent to availability API. Also added automatic validation when duration changes to prevent conflicting bookings.
- **Nov 17, 2025**: 📋 ENHANCED BLOCKED SLOT DIAGNOSTICS - Added detailed error messages showing exactly which bookings conflict when creating blocked slots, including booking IDs, times, and status.
