## Recent Changes
- **Nov 17, 2025**: 🔧 CRITICAL AVAILABILITY FIX - Fixed booking calendar not showing existing bookings as unavailable. Date parameter wasn't being sent to availability API. Also added automatic validation when duration changes to prevent conflicting bookings.
- **Nov 17, 2025**: 📋 ENHANCED BLOCKED SLOT DIAGNOSTICS - Added detailed error messages showing exactly which bookings conflict when creating blocked slots, including booking IDs, times, and status. System already filters out cancelled bookings from conflict detection.
- **Nov 16, 2025**: 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - PAYMENT VERIFICATION - Fixed critical bug where bookings were created without verifying payment success. Backend now validates with Stripe that payment actually succeeded and amount matches before creating booking. This prevents "payment charged but booking failed" scenarios.
